# professional-portfolio

## Description
- This is a portfolio that I have built to give people more of a background about me and my current role and to view some projects I have made. It was created with HTML and CSS, where I have gone through and created both the HTML and CSS files from scratch to better improve my styling skills.
- As I went through this project, I was able to learn more about Semantic HTML Elements and how nesting works better within HTML and how to target specific sections better in CSS. I was also able to gain a better understanding of how to build a Mobile first deisgn website and utilize flexbox as I had gone through building my site to fit different screen sizes and have the content shrink properly.
- Here is a link to view the full site: [Professional Portfolio](https://canadianfaller7.github.io/my-portfolio/ "Named link title")
